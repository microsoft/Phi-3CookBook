    "# Azure AI Search with NVIDIA NIM and LlamaIndex Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate how to leverage NVIDIA's AI models and LlamaIndex to create a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. We'll use NVIDIA's LLMs and embeddings, integrate them with Azure AI Search as the vector store, and perform RAG to enhance search quality and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Leverage NVIDIA's large language models and Azure AI Search for scalable and efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize search and retrieval with efficient vector storage and hybrid search techniques.\n",
    "- **High Performance**: Combine powerful LLMs with vectorized search for faster and more accurate responses.\n",
    "- **Quality**: Maintain high search quality by grounding LLM responses with relevant retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- 🐍 Python 3.9 or higher\n",
    "- 🔗 [Azure AI Search Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/)\n",
    "- 🔗 NVIDIA API Key for access to NVIDIA's LLMs and Embeddings via the NVIDIA NIM microservices\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features Covered\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA LLM Integration (we'll use [Phi-3.5-MOE](https://build.nvidia.com/microsoft/phi-3_5-moe))\n",
    "- ✅ NVIDIA Embeddings (we'll use [nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5))\n",
    "- ✅ Azure AI Search Advanced Retreival Modes\n",
    "- ✅ Document Indexing with LlamaIndex\n",
