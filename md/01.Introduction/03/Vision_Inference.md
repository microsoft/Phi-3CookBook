# **Inference Phi-3-Vision in Local**

Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct allows Phi-3 to not only understand language, but also see the world visually. Through Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct, we can solve different visual problems, such as OCR, table analysis, object recognition, describe the picture etc. We can easily complete tasks that previously required a lot of data training. The following are related techniques and application scenarios cited by Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct

## **0. Preparation**

Please make sure the following Python libraries have been installed before use (Python 3.10+ is recommended)

```bash
pip install transformers -U
pip install datasets -U
pip install torch -U
```

It is recommended to use ***CUDA 11.6+*** and install flatten

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Create a new Notebook. To complete the examples, it is recommended that you create the following content first.

```python
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from transformers import AutoProcessor

model_id = "microsoft/Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct"

kwargs = {}
kwargs['torch_dtype'] = torch.bfloat16

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, trust_remote_code=True, torch_dtype="auto").cuda()

user_prompt = '<|user|>\n'
assistant_prompt = '<|assistant|>\n'
prompt_suffix = "<|end|>\n"
```

## **1. Analyze the image with Phi-3-Vision**

We want AI to be able to analyze the content of our pictures and give relevant descriptions

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\nCould you please introduce this stock to me?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"


url = "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/767633/nvidiadatacenterrevenuefy2017tofy2024.png"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(prompt, image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )
generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, 
                                  skip_special_tokens=True, 
                                  clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

We can get the relevant answers by executing the following script in Notebook

## **2. OCR with Phi-3-Vision**

In addition to analyzing the image, we can also extract information from the image. This is the OCR process that we used to need to write complex code to complete.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\nHelp me get the title and author information of this book?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"

url = "https://marketplace.canva.com/EAFPHUaBrFc/1/0/1003w/canva-black-and-white-modern-alone-story-book-cover-QHBKwQnsgzs.jpg"

image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(prompt, image, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, 
                                  skip_special_tokens=False, 
                                  clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]

```

The result is

```txt
The title of the book is "ALONE" and the author is Morgan Maxwell.
```

## **3. Comparison of multiple images**

Phi-3 Vision supports comparison of multiple images. We can use this model to find the differences between the images.

```python
prompt = f"{user_prompt}<|image_1|>\n<|image_2|>\n What is difference in this two images?{prompt_suffix}{assistant_prompt}"

print(f">>> Prompt\n{prompt}")

url = "https://hinhnen.ibongda.net/upload/wallpaper/doi-bong/2012/11/22/arsenal-wallpaper-free.jpg"

image_1 = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

url = "https://assets-webp.khelnow.com/d7293de2fa93b29528da214253f1d8d0/news/uploads/2021/07/Arsenal-1024x576.jpg.webp"

image_2 = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

images = [image_1, image_2]

inputs = processor(prompt, images, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda:0")

generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, 
                              max_new_tokens=1000,
                              eos_token_id=processor.tokenizer.eos_token_id,
                              )

generate_ids = generate_ids[:, inputs['input_ids'].shape[1]:]

response = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

The result is

```txt
The first image shows a group of soccer players from the Arsenal Football Club posing for a team photo with their trophies, while the second image shows a group of soccer players from the Arsenal Football Club celebrating a victory with a large crowd of fans in the background. The difference between the two images is the context in which the photos were taken, with the first image focusing on the team and their trophies, and the second image capturing a moment of celebration and victory.
```
