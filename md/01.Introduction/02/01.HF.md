# **Using Phi Family in Hugging Face**


[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a very popular AI community with rich data and open source model resources. Different manufacturers will release open source LLM and SLM through Hugging Face, such as Microsoft, Meta, Mistral, Apple, Google, etc.

Microsoft Phi Family has been released on Hugging Face. Developers can download the corresponding Phi Family's model based on scenarios and businesses。In addition to deploying Phi Pytorch models on Hugging Face, we also released quantized models, using GGUF and ONNX formats to give end users a choice.
